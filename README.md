# CSC450-RoutingProject

A Project by Cameron Thomas and Blake Perrin

## Desc

The goal is to implement both Link-State and Distance-Vestor routing algorithms from CSC-450 in python.
Our program will read network data from a CSV file and calculate the lowest cost routes using algorithms we learned in class.
